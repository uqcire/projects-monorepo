# Cirq

**Cirq** is a personal relationship OS — built to help you remember, reconnect, and relate better with the people who matter.

With smart reminders, timeline tracking, and AI-powered interaction insights, Cirq transforms your contact list into a dynamic, evolving network of relationships — not just static names and numbers.

---

## 🌟 Vision

In a world of infinite connectivity and growing digital silence, Cirq aims to restore intentionality to human relationships. It’s not just a contact manager — it’s a memory companion, a social radar, and a gentle guide to staying meaningfully connected.

> Cirq exists for those who believe relationships deserve rhythm, memory, and mindfulness.

We want Cirq to be:
- A **relationship journal** you don’t have to write in.
- A **contact assistant** that remembers what you forget.
- A **social mirror** that helps you better understand the people around you — and yourself.

---

## 📌 Core Philosophy

- **Proactive > Passive**
  Don’t wait until you forget someone to realize it. Cirq reminds you before it’s too late.

- **Context-Aware > Static Lists**
  Contacts are dynamic. They evolve with events, memories, and life phases. So should your tools.

- **Private by Design**
  All your memories, notes, and insights stay local or encrypted. You own your network.

- **AI as a Relationship Assistant, not a Replacement**
  Cirq uses AI to enhance your awareness, not to automate your feelings.

## ✨ Let’s Redesign Relationship Memory

If your social tools can remind you of meetings, why can’t they remind you of memories?
